1. Install the http-server package via npm. If you don't have npm installed, follow the install instructions on the Node.JS website. After that, run the following command:
> $ npm install -g http-server
2. Create a private key and a certificate via openssl. This is necessary to run the secure local server.
> $ cd path/to/my/game/
> $ openssl genrsa 2048 > key.pem
> $ openssl req -x509 -days 1000 -new -key key.pem -out cert.pem
# Fill out necessary information
3. Run the game from localhost with SSL. Once the key and certificate are ready, you can serve from localhost using SSL.
# Starts to serve via HTTPS, with cache disabled
> $ http-server --ssl -c-1 -p 8080 -a 127.0.0.1 
Starting up http-server, serving ./ through https
Available on:
https://127.0.0.1:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
4. After this, pointing your browser to https://localhost:8080 should show you the game running.
Note: You must try to access it at least once, as you might need to approve a security warning from your browser before continuing. If that is the case and you skip this step, your game will not load.

Running the embedded player from your browser
Now that the game is being served from localhost via a secure connection, you can embed it in our player. Point your browser here:
